The fundamental steps involved in the process of connecting to a database and executing a query consist of the following:
Import JDBC packages.
Load and register the JDBC driver.
Open a connection to the database.
Create a statement object to perform a query.
Execute the statement object and return a query resultset.
Process the resultset.
Close the resultset and statement objects.
Close the connection.

Q3.What are the types of statement in JDBC in java?

Callable Statement

Q4.What is Servlet in Java?

Robust: JVM manages Servlets, so we don't need to worry about the memory leak, garbage collection, etc.
Secure: because it uses java language.

Q10.What are the limitations of JSP?
Ans.
As the JSP is compiled on the server, it is not memory and time-efficient. 
It is hard to track errors in JSP files because they are an extension to Servlets. 
The JSP codes are processed into Servlet codes for compilation.
