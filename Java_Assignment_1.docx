Q1.What is the difference between Compiler and Interpreter
Ans1.
Compiler -> It is a software which takes sourcecode(HLL) as the input and generates MLL code as the ouput.
To convert the HLL code to MLL code compiler will scan the HLL code only once.
Compiler will speed up the process

Interpreter =>It is a software which takes sourcecode(HLL) as the input and generates MLL code as the ouput.
To convert the HLL code to MLL code interpreter will scan the HLL code mulitple times(depends on the instrcutions).
Interpreter will slow down the process.

Q2.What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
Ans2.
=> JDK :: Java Development kit, it provides libraries and the requried files to run our java programs.
=> JRE :: Java RunTimeEnvironment, It provides suitable environment to run our java program.
=> JVM :: Java Virtual Machine, It is responsible to run our java programs on the basis of MultiThreading.

Q3.How many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM?
Ans3.
Types of Memory Areas Allocated By the JVM:
=> Class(Method) Area
=> Heap.
=> Program Counter Register.
=> Native Method Stack.

Q4.What is JIT compiler?
Ans4.
JIT stands for Java-In-Time Compiler. The JIT compilation is also known as dynamic compilation.
A just-in-time (JIT) compiler is a program that turns bytecode into instructions that can be sent directly to a computer's processor (CPU).

Q5.What are the various access specifiers in Java?
Ans5.
=> Public
=> Private
=> Protected
=> Default

Q6.What is a compiler in Java?
Ans6.
Java compilers are programs that take source code and produce class files containing platform-independent Java bytecode that can be executed by the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Q7.Explain the types of variables in Java?
Ans7.
=> Local variables
=> Static variables
=> Instance variables

Q8.What are the Datatypes in Java?
Ans8.
Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. 
There are two types of data types in Java:
Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.

Q9.What are the identifiers in java?
Ans9.
Identifer is a name in java program.
Identifer can be classname,methodname,variablename,labelname.

Q10.Explain the architecture of JVM 
Ans10.
JVM is the engine that drives the Java Code. 
It converts Java bytecode into machine language. 
JVM architecture in Java contains classloader, memory area, execution engine, etc.
