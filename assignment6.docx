Q1.1. Write a program to show Interface Example in java?
Ans. interface printable{  
void print();  
}  
class A6 implements printable{  
public void print(){System.out.println("Hello");}  
  
public static void main(String args[]){  
A6 obj = new A6();  
obj.print();  
 }  
}  

Q2.Write a program a Program with 2 concrete method and 2 abstract method in java ?
Ans. abstract class AbstractExample {  
   
    // Abstract method  
    abstract void display();  
    abstract void add(); 
    // Concrete method  
    void show()  
    {  
        System.out.println("Concrete method of abstract class");  
    } 
    void subtract()  
    {  
        System.out.println("Concrete method of abstract class doing subtraction");  
    }  
}  
   
// Subclass of abstract class  
class SubClass extends AbstractExample {  
   
    // Implementing the abstract method  
    void display()  
    {  
        System.out.println("Abstract method implemented");  
    }  
    void add()  
    {  
        System.out.println("abstract method implemented  doing addition");  
    }  


}  
   
/** 
 * Main class 
 */  
public class AbstractClass{  
   
    public static void main(String args[])  
    {  
        // Creating an object of the subclass  
        SubClass obj = new SubClass();  
   
        // Calling the abstract method  
        obj.display();  
         obj.add();  
   
        // Calling the concrete method  
        obj.show();  
       obj.subtract();  
    }  
}  
Q3.Write a program to show the use of functional interface in java?
Ans. // Java program to demonstrate functional interface

class Test {
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		// create anonymous inner class object
		new Thread(new Runnable() {
			@Override public void run()
			{
				System.out.println("New thread created");
			}
		}).start();
	}
}

Q4.What is an interface in Java?
Ans. An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods. The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction.

Q5.What is the use of interface in Java?
Ans. Interfaces are used in Java to achieve abstraction. By using the implements keyword, a java class can implement an interface. In general terms, an interface can be defined as a container that stores the signatures of the methods to be implemented in the code segment. It improves the levels of Abstraction.

Q6.What is the lambda expression of Java 8?
Ans. Java Lambda Expressions are the short block of code that accepts input as parameters and returns a resultant value.

Q7.Can you pass lambda expressions to a method? When?
Ans.A lambda expression can be passed to a method as an argument. 

Q8.What is the functional interface in Java 8?
Ans. A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method.They can have only one functionality to exhibit. From Java 8 onwards, lambda expressions can be used to represent the instance of a functional interface. A functional interface can have any number of default methods.

Q9.What is the benefit of lambda expressions in Java 8?
Ans. Lambda expressions improve code readability and do not require interpretation. Lambdas allow you to write concise code. It encourages the use of functional programming. It simplifies variable scope and encourages code reusability.

Q10.Is it mandatory for a lambda expression to have parameters?
Ans. A lambda expression is characterized by the following syntax. Following are the important characteristics of a lambda expression. Optional type declaration âˆ’ No need to declare the type of a parameter. The compiler can inference the same from the value of the parameter.
