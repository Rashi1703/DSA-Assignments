Q8.Write a program to sort a String Alphabetically
Ans.  import java.util.*;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		String str;
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
       System.out.println("Enter the string : ");
		str = sc.nextLine();
		int j = 0;
		char temp = 0;
		char[] chars = str.toCharArray();
		for (int i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
				for (j = 0; j < chars.length; j++) {
						if (chars[j] > chars[i]) {
								temp = chars[i];
								chars[i] = chars[j];
								chars[j] = temp;
						}
				}
		}
	System.out.println("The sorted string is : ");
	for (int i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
		System.out.print(chars[i]);
		}


	}
}


Q9.Write a program to check if the letter 'e' is present in the word
'Umbrella'.
Ans.
public class find_char{
	public static void main(String[] args){

		if(i==-1){
			System.out.println("Not found");
		}
		else{
			System.out.println("found at "+i);
		}
	}
}
